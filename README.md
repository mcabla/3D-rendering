### Demo overview

With the navigation bar you can choose between different demo's.

Short overview: 

- Natural: This world combines the natural phenomenon from all the demo's and integrates them into one world that mimics a natural environment.  
- Boids: This example implements boid behaviour using 6 simple rules. 
- Fireflies 2: Mimicking firefly behaviour using a particle system. 
- Perlin LOD: This demo features a single chunk with automatically generated terrain. Zooming in and out with the mouse wheel automatically adjusts the level of detail automatically. The terrain generation is based on adding different levels of Perlin noise together. 
- Tree 2D: ?
- Tree: (check this) This demo contains different tree species generated using L-systems. 
- Clouds: Simulated clouds using a particle system.

I mateo wrote all the code myself. I did take inspiration from Casper's implementation of the terrain world. 
I also based it of this blog: https://blog.mastermaps.com/2013/10/terrain-building-with-threejs.html
